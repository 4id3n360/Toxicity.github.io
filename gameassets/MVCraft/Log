I decided to make a log cause why not
DAY 1
Just finished MVCraft, and I'm pretty proud. Haven't gone insane... at least yet.
Hope this doesn't get dmca'd, 'cause that would be pretty bad
Imagine if the school finds out about this

DAY 2
Today was really just about cleaning up. The website looks way better now, and now there's not a giant MV logo in the background.
I really have some good visions for this website. I'm excited for it's future.
I'm right now in the process of adding 1v1.lol. 
Welp I have nothing else... Bye!
