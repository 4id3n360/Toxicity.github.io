DAY 1
Just finished MVCraft, and I'm pretty proud. Haven't gone insane... at least yet.

DAY 2
Today was really just about cleaning up. The website looks way better now, and now there's not a giant MV logo in the background.
I really have some good visions for this website. I'm excited for it's future.
I'm right now in the process of adding 1v1.lol. 
Welp I have nothing else... Bye!
